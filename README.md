# Customer_App-


The data set is of a fintech company which wants it's customer to get enrolled to it paid version of the app which provide premium features.
The company started with a free trial with some of it's main features unlocked.

The  task is to identify  which customers will buy the paid features app and which will not buy so that additional offers can be given to them
and get them enrolled.

The data is about the customer app behaviour from the time app was installed and what all screens the user went by and for what duration,
the free trail is for 24 hours only.
